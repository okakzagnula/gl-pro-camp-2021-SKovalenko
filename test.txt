I was looking for a way to use the same repo via SSH on new machine, and hardly found that the best way is to generate new pair of keys -> add one more public key to your git account. Spent ~4 hours trying to apply existing public key without copying of the private one, as it is said to be insecure.

forgot syntax at all - git push origin myNewBranch
